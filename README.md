# Employee-and-Salary-data-cleaned

Amidst the pandemic many people lost their jobs, with this dataset it is possible to hone the job search so that more people in need can find employment.
This dataset was created by picklesueat and contains more than 2000 job listing for data analyst positions, with features such as:

Salary Estimate
Location
Company Rating
Job Description
and more.

I have done cleaning for this Kaggle dataset using Pandas.
